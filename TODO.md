preview, diff command mode


readfile, directory, writefile commands for use from a litpro doc.

maybe a built in watcher program, using nodemon?  
command line: read file, readdir, write file, file encodings, curling, 

plugins: jshint, jstidy, jade, markdown,

development versus deployment? Maybe manage it with different lprc files. So
default is development, but then one production ready, switch to lprc-prod.js
which could send to a different build directory. Also minify commands, etc.,
could be available in both, but changed so that in development they are a
passthru noop. 

testing. a module export that gives a nice test function that allows for easy
testing.

literate-programming-cli   
====================

This is the command line client for literate-programming. 

Install using `npm install literate-programming-cli`

Usage is `./node_modules/bin/litpro file` and it has some command flags. 

If you want a global install so that you just need to write `litpro` then use
`npm install -g literate-programming-cli`. 

## Flags

The various flags are

* -e, --encoding Specify the default encoding. It defaults to utf8, but any
  encoding supported by iconv-lite works. To override that behavior per loaded
  file from a document, one can put the encoding between the colon and pipe in
  the directive title. This applies to both reading and writing. 
* -f, --file A specified file to process. It is possible to have multiple
  files, each proceeded by an option. Also any unclaimed arguments will be
  assumed to be a file that gets added to the list. 
* -l, --lprc This specifies the lprc.js file to use. None need not be
  provided. The lprc file should export a function that takes in as arguments
  the Folder constructor and an args object (what is processed from the
  command line). This allows for quite a bit of sculpting. See more in lprc. 
* -b, --build  The build directory. Defaults to build. Will create it if it
  does not exist. Specifying . will use the current directory. 
* -s, --src  The source directory to look for files from load directives. The
  files specified on the command line are used as is while those loaded from
  those files are prefixed. Shell tab completion is a reaoson for this
  difference. 
* -c, --cache The cache is a place for assets downloaded from the web.
* --cachefile This gives an alternate name for the cache file that registers
  what is downloaded. Default is `.cache`
* -d, --diff This computes the difference between each files from their
  existing versions. There is no saving of files.
